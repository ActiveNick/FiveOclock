# FiveOclock
Ever wanted to have a drink but it's too early in the day and you're afraid it's not socially acceptable to drink so early? What is it we tell ourselves to justify that early beer or glass of wine? It's five o'clock somewhere!!! But what if you want to know in which cities around the world is it 5:00PM now?

Five O'clock is a simple Cortana extensibility UWP app for Windows 10 that lets you extend the vocabulary of Cortana so you can her "Hey Cortana, it's 5 o'clock where?" and she will happily search for drinking destinations around the globe, showing you a list of cities where people are happily drinking now.

The app is written in C# and makes use of the Cortana background Voice Commands (VCD). Note that if you want to demo this and it's actually past 5:00PM, I recommend changing your time zone to roll back time so it tricks your computer to think it's earlier.
